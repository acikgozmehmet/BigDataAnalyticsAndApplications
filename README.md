# BigDataAnalyticsAndApplications
COURSE DESCRIPTION :

Big Data analytics focus on analyzing large amounts of data to find useful information and to make use of the information for better business decisions. This course introduces students to the practice and potential of big data analytics and applications. In this course, students will have hand-on experience with Big Data Analytics technologies (Apache Spark, TensorFlow) and tools (Intellij, Pycharm, Maven/SBT, MongoDB) for the analysis of big data sets with mobile/Web apps (Visual Question answering, Image Classification). Students will learn how to develop highly interactive and real-time applications for intelligent robots.
