        "\n",
        "1. Rewards\n",
        "\n",
        "Since the agent (the imaginary driver) is reward-motivated and is going to learn how to control the cab by trial experiences in the environment, we need to decide the rewards and/or penalties and their magnitude accordingly. Here a few points to consider:\n",
        "\n",
        "The agent should receive a high positive reward for a successful dropoff because this behavior is highly desired\n",
        "\n",
        "The agent should be penalized if it tries to drop off a passenger in wrong locations\n",
        "\n",
        "The agent should get a slight negative reward for not making it to the destination after every time-step. \"Slight\" negative because we would prefer our agent to reach late instead of making wrong moves trying to reach to the destination as fast as possible\n",
        "\n",
        "2. State Space\n",
        "\n",
        "In Reinforcement Learning, the agent encounters a state, and then takes action according to the state it's in.\n",
        "\n",
        "The State Space is the set of all possible situations our taxi could inhabit. The state should contain useful information the agent needs to make the right action.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's say we have a training area for our Smartcab where we are teaching it to transport people in a parking lot to four different locations (R, G, Y, B).\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's assume Smartcab is the only vehicle in this parking lot. We can break up the parking lot into a 5x5 grid, which gives us 25 possible taxi locations. These 25 locations are one part of our state space.\n",
        "\n",
        "You'll also notice there are four (4) locations that we can pick up and drop off a passenger: R, G, Y, B or [(0,0), (0,4), (4,0), (4,3)] in (row, col) coordinates. \n",
        "\n",
        "When we also account for one (1) additional passenger state of being inside the taxi, we can take all combinations of passenger locations and destination locations to come to a total number of states for our taxi environment; there's four (4) destinations and five (4 + 1) passenger locations.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, our taxi environment has 5×5×5×4=500 total possible states.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Action Space\n",
        "\n",
        "The agent encounters one of the 500 states and it takes an action. The action in our case can be to move in a direction or decide to pickup/dropoff a passenger.\n",
        "\n",

        "north\n",

        "This is the action space: the set of all the actions that our agent can take in a given state.\n",
        "\n",
        "Also, the taxi cannot perform certain actions in certain states due to walls. In environment's code, we will simply provide a -1 penalty for every wall hit and the taxi won't move anywhere. This will just rack up penalties causing the taxi to consider going around the wall.\n",
